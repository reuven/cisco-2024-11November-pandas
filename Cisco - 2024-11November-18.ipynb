    "Jupyter is the latest evolution of IPython, a command-line replacement for the standard `python` interactive shell. It gives you the illusion that Python is running in your browser, and lets you run code in it. Really, though, there's a backend Python process that is running all of the code.\n",

    "\n",
    "- In *edit mode*, which I'm in now, typing adds text to the current cell. You can enter edit mode by clicking in the cell or by pressing ENTER. This is how we add code and/or documentation.\n",
    "- In *command mode*, anything we type (typically one-letter commands) is sent to Jupyter to give it instructions. You can enter command mode by clicking to the left of the cell or by pressing ESC.\n",
